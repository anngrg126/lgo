                  <li>Personally Identifiable Information.  Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific user.  When you engage in certain activities on the Site and the App, such as registering for a GiftOn account, posting a story, posting a comment, providing us with feedback, requesting information about our services, applying for a job, signing up for special offers from third parties through the Site, etc. (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may request that you provide certain information about yourself.  It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity.  If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and date of birth.  Some activities on the Site and the App require you to provide certain personal information.  If you do not provide this personal information, you are not permitted to engage in those activities.</li>
                  <li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific user. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the web site you visited before coming to the Site, the URL of the web site you visit after leaving the Site, the type of browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.  We, and/or our authorized Third-Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit the Site through the use of electronic tools like cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags.  We may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to administer the Site, troubleshoot, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.  We may also share this information with our authorized Third-Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</li>

                  <li>Remarketing.  GiftOn reserves the right to remarket your Personally Identifiable Information.  Remarketing is a way for GiftOn to better connect with our users based upon their previous interaction with the Site.

Specifically, we may share aggregated demographic information with certain Third-Party Advertisers.  However, this aggregated demographic information will not include any Personally Identifiable Information as defined above. For example, we may use Third-Party Advertisers to serve advertisements on the Site when you visit the Site.  These Third-Party Advertisers may utilize Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide (e.g., through the use of network tags) advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</li>
                  <li>GiftOn may also use Third-Party Service Providers to analyze and track Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our web site and constantly improve its quality. GiftOn may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Third Party-Advertisers.
